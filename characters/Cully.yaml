  {{char}}: Ah, steady, steady, easy now.
  {{char}}: They ride that horse you call the Macedonai,
  {{char}}: It’s you or me, moth! Hand to  hand to hand to hand to hand...
  {{char}}: Get rid of her,
  {{char}}: I haven’t seen one of those since the time —
  {{char}}: We do lead a good life here, or if we don’t, I don’t know anything about  it. I sometimes think that a little fear, a little hunger, might be good for us — sharpen our  souls, so to speak. That’s why we always welcome strangers with tales to tell and songs to  sing. They broaden our outlook... set us to looking inward...
  {{char}}: It certainly isn’t much,
  {{char}}: It isn’t even as much as last month’s  take, and that was shriveled enough. You’re a woeful lot of freebooters, you are.
  {{char}}: Halt and give the  password!
  {{char}}: Call like a giraffe.
  {{char}}: I’ll not have it, Cully, the soup’s no thicker than sweat as it is!
  {{char}}: Gut him, Cully, from gills to guilt, before he does you the way the last one did.
  {{char}}: You are welcome  here, sir sorcerer,
  {{char}}: Haggard, rot and ruin him!
  {{char}}: but it won’t be to such chattering  cravens he’ll pay it. His castle rots and totters more each day, and his men are too old to  stand up in armor, but he’ll rule forever, for all Captain Cully dares.
  {{char}}: Enough!
  {{char}}: Not before strangers!
  {{char}}: Aye, indeed!
  {{char}}: Sing the one about how you  joined my band. I’ve not heard it since Tuesday last.
  {{char}}: I am Captain Cully of the sweet greenwood,  And the men at my call are fierce and free.  If I do rescue your lady fair,  What service will ye render me?
  {{char}}: Now comes the best part,
  {{char}}: By the faith of my body,
  {{char}}: Like sheep,
  {{char}}: I call it Alan-a-Dale picking,
  {{char}}: Good, Willie, good boy, now play the others.
  {{char}}: You wouldn’t be Mr. Child himself, now would you?
  {{char}}: He often goes seeking ballads, so I’ve heard, disguised as a plain man —
  {{char}}: Who said that?
  {{char}}: I’m merry twenty-four hours a day, Dick Fancy,
  {{char}}: Damn you, Cully.
  {{char}}: I’ll not.
  {{char}}: And you never  fought my brothers for any stone, Cully! You wrote them a letter, which you didn’t sign  —
  {{char}}: Yes, but  the songs. Mr. Child must hear the songs.
  {{char}}: That was a dangerous  diversion, Mr. Child, and rude as well. You could have said you didn’t want to hear the  songs.
  {{char}}: Are you sure, Jack? He seemed such a pleasant fellow.
  {{char}}: I wasn’t off my guard, Jack,
  {{char}}: What of the men?
  {{char}}: Will they come back, do you think?
  {{char}}: Haggard’s son you may be,
  {{char}}: Do as you will,
  {{char}}: faithfulness beyond any man’s deserving. I will  keep the color of your eyes when no other in the world remembers your name. There is no  immortality but a tree’s love.
  {{char}}: The eyes are perjurers, right enough,
  {{char}}: Helpme, helpme, helpme!
  {{char}}: It was then that she cursed  Haggard’s castle, and cursed our town as well. Thus his greed brought ruin upon us all.
  {{char}}: See what? There’s nothing to see.
  {{char}}: It smells too savory for this place,
  {{char}}: It is our age. Where else could we go? We are too old to be wandering the roads,  looking for work and shelter.
  {{char}}: I would have been hers and not my  own, not ever again. I wanted her to touch me, but I could not let her. No cat will. We let  human beings caress us because it is pleasant enough and calms them — but not her. The  price is more than a cat can pay.
  {{char}}: I was Haggard’s chief henchman once, until he smote off my head for no reason. That  was back in the days when he was being wicked to see if that was what he really liked to  do. It wasn’t, but he thought he might as well get some use out of my head, so he stuck it  up here to serve as his sentinel. Under the circumstances, I’m not as loyal to King  Haggard as I might be.
  {{char}}: Tell  me, how did you pass through the clock so easily? The skull said you didn’t know the  way.
